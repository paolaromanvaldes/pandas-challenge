In this challenge we will use pandas to analyze data provided by a fictional school system into different categories. 

In this project, calculate various summary statistics for the district, including:

Total number of schools

Total number of students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

Percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)

Percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)

Percentage of students who passed both math and reading (% Overall Passing)

Create a DataFrame to store these results and, if desired, format the displayed data for clarity.

Creating DataFrames for individual school grades in math and reading based on school grade. 

Create DataFrames for school size, spending per student, and school type. 

Then analyzing the outputs for the client.
